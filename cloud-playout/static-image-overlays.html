    <p>You can use the static image overlay feature to superimpose a static image onto a video in a Cloud Playout channel. A static image is a still image that doesn't have motion. You prepare the image and store it outside of Cloud Playout and provide to us as a publicly accessible , unauthenticated http/https URL.</p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to insert a static image overlay at a specific time during the channelâ€™s runtime and run it for 10 seconds. You want the image overlay to appear in the lower-right corner of the video frame. You want the image overlay to have 50% opacity.</li>
      <li>You want to insert two static image overlays so that they both appear in the video frame either at the same time or with some overlap. You want the display of the image overlays to slightly overlap so that one image overlay appears in a location and, while that image overlay is still showing, another image overlay appears in another location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The image that you overlay on a video should be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA">.tga</a> or a .png file.</li>
      <li>
        Create and manage static overlay images for an account using the new side menu item:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/overlays-menu-item.png" alt="Overlays">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Overlays</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        The overlay images then can be associated with a channel:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/overlay-associate-with-channel.png" alt="Associate Overlay with Channel">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Associate Overlay with Channel</figcaption>
        </figure>

          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Overlays in Draft Channel</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/overlays-for-running-channel.png" alt="Overlays in Running Channel">

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can insert up to two <strong>layers</strong> at one time. Each image should be a <strong>separate layer</strong>. If different images are scheduled on same layer for the same time or if they overlap during any time window, then the image that is provisioned later will remove the existing image on the same layer.
          <ul>
            <li>The layers are in Z order, which means that <strong>overlays with higher values of layer are inserted on top of overlays with lower values of layer</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You can set up the overlays to all appear on the underlying video at the same time (or not), and you can set them up to physically overlap each other (or not).</li>
      <li>
        You can configure each image overlay with a start time and duration:
        <ul>
          <li>If the duration is set, the maximum duration is 24 hours</li>
          <li>If the duration is not set, the overlay will continue to be shown until deactivated</li>
          <li>Start time must be a future time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You can configure with an opacity of 0 - 100. <strong>0</strong> is transparent and <strong>100</strong> is fully opaque.</li>
      <li>You can position the image overlay on the video frame, as specified by x/y coordinates. By default X, Y coordinates are considered as 0, 0 (the top left edge of a video frame)</li>
      <li>
        You can position the image overlay on the video frame, as specified by x/y coordinates. By default the X, Y coordinates are considered as 0, 0 (<strong>the top left corner of a video frame</strong>):
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Position X</strong>: the position of the left edge of the overlay relative to the left edge of the video frame, in pixels. If the placement causes the overlay to extend beyond the right edge of the underlying video, then the overlay will be cropped on the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Position Y</strong>: the position of the top edge of the overlay relative to the top edge of the video frame, in pixels. If the placement causes the overlay to extend beyond the bottom edge of the underlying video, then the overlay will be cropped on the bottom.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sizing:</strong> the <strong>Use Original</strong> option can be used for Resolution to use the original resolution of the supplied image:

          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Use Original Image Size</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
