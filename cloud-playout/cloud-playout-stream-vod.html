          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">New Channel</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Identification</strong> details:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name</strong> - Name for the channel. The name must have English characters and the following special characters are allowed:   _ . : / = + - </li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong> - Channel description</li>
          <li><strong>Image URL</strong> - URL to an image file for the channel; meant to be a channel image that could be retrieved as part of the channel's metadata</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Schedule</strong> details.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> - If <strong>On</strong>, the program will be played in a loop and the <strong>End Date/Time</strong> will be enabled. The program can still be modified at any time and the changes will be reflected in the current program and the loops to follow. See the <a href="#looping">Creating a looping program</a> section below.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad Insertion</strong> - If on, allows ads to be displayed during channel playback. If this option is selected, Live inputs are not allowed, and you can only output to a <strong>Brightcove Live Event or</strong> <strong>Amazon S3 Bucket</strong>. See the <a href="#ads">Enabling Server-Side Ads</a> section below.</li>
          <li><strong>Start Date/Time</strong> - Time when the channel will start playing out. The start time for all assets will be calculated by adding their duration to this start time. This time can be updated only when the channel is not in running state.</li>
          <li><strong>End Date/Time</strong> - If no value is entered and <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is not selected, the stream will end once the playout is complete. If <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is selected and there is no <strong>End Date/Time</strong>, the playout will be streamed until the channel is stopped. This time can be updated at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you will be using Live inputs, set <strong>Live Input</strong> to On, and enter a Slate URL, unless you are going to use the default Brightcove MP4 for you slate. The slate MP4 will play whenever Live input is stopped because the encoder is stopped or some technical issue blocks the live stream. <strong>Note that <strong>the Slate URL must be a static URL that is always available</strong> (short-lived CDN URLs are not allowed).</strong></li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Destination</strong> details. Cloud Playout  supports 2 outputs at the same time. For example, you can output HLS into an S3 Bucket and an RTMP feed to  a Brightcove Live Channel or a 3rd party ingestion point. Note that <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> and <strong>RTMP</strong> is not supported.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optimize Display for</strong> - Controls the bitrate and dimensions for the output
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mobile &amp; Web</strong> - If checked, HD Output (RTMP or HLS single bitrate)</li>
              <li><strong>Smart TV</strong> - If checked, full HD Output (RTMP or HLS single bitrate)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Output Region</strong> - The region where the channel will be created. Brightcove recommends selecting a region geographically closest to where the majority of your audience is expected.</li>
          <li><strong>Output to</strong> - Select an output method for the channel
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> - Create or use a previously created Brightcove Live  Channel. When creating a new channel, the region of the channel will be optimized based upon the <strong>Output Region</strong> that was selected.</li>
              <li><strong>RTMP</strong> - Select to output the stream to an RTMP or RTP ingestion point. RTP is not available for third party ingestion points, only when <strong>Ad Insertion</strong> and <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> is enabled. When selected, an <strong>RTMP URL</strong> field will appear - enter the RTMP input URL for your live streaming service.</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon S3 Bucket </strong>- Select to push an HLS output to an Amazon S3 bucket. You will be required to enter Bucket Name, Region, Access Key and Secret Key. The bucket should be public and writeable.</li>

    <h2 id="ads">Enabling Server-Side Ads</h2>
    <p>It is possible to configure a channel so that server-side ads are displayed using Brightcove's Server-Side Ad Insertion technology. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes: 
      <ul>
        <li>When using ad insertion, the channel can only be output to a Brightcove Live Event.</li>
        <li>If you enable ad insertion, Live Inputs may not be used in the channel.</li>
      </ul>
      </aside>
    <h3>Configuring Ad tags and fill slates</h3>
    <p>Ensure that you have ad tags and fill slates configured as part of your account administration. For information on configuring ad tags, see <a href="/admin/configuring-server-side-ad-settings.html">Configuring Server-Side Ad Settings</a>. Fill slates are content that can be served when there are gaps in a live stream ad break. For information on creating fill slates, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Managing Live Settings</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Cloud Playout will use the default ad slate configured as part of the <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Live Settings</a>.</aside>
    </p>
    <h3>Creating placeholder ad break videos</h3>
    <p>You need to indicate which video(s) should be used as "placeholder" videos. "Placeholder" videos will be inserted into the program listing to indicate that an ad should be served and the length of the ad. This needs to be done because when using Server-Side Ad Insertion with Brightcove Live, the "placeholder" video will be replaced with ad content. If you do not insert an ad "placeholder" video, parts of the actual video will be replaced with ad content. If the ad duration is shorter than the ad returned, SSAI will show the ad slate. If the ad duration is longer than the ads returned, the ads will be displayed followed by the ad slate. </p>
    <p>You may need to create/upload video source files that have video lengths equal to the ad break durations you want to have (i.e. 2 mins, 4 mins, etc.). The content of these videos doesn't matter as they will not actually be played as part of a program. </p>
    <p>To mark a video as a "placeholder" video, use the Media module to edit the video properties for these videos and tag them with <code translate="No">cp-ad-holder</code>.
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-ad-tag-video.png" /></figure>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For existing channels, the Ad Insertion setting cannot be changed.</aside>
    <h3>Inserting ad placeholders into a program</h3>
    <p>You need to insert ad placeholders into the program listing where ads should be displayed. Follow these steps to insert ad placeholders.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Click a channel name to edit it.</li>
      <li>In the program listing, click the checkbox next to the video <strong>after</strong> which you want an ad to play.</li>

    <h2 id="publish">Generating the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel</h2>
    <p>To generate the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel, you will use the Live module. For full details on using the Live module, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/live-module/creating-and-managing-live-events-using-live-module.html">Creating and Managing Live Events using the Live Module</a>.</p>
    <p>Two types of embed code are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard</strong> - iframe embed code. Recommended for most cases. This type places the player inside an &lt;iframe&gt; tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced</strong> - In-page embed code. Allows the player to exist in the HTML page directly, not in an iframe. This offers developers the benefits of ease of accessing the player and associated properties and events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also have the ability to get the URL to the published player. This is useful for viewing the event in a browser.</p>

      <li>The maximum input bitrate and resolution supported for Cloud Playout is 20MBPS/1080p. This applies both to VOD content and live inputs.</li>
      <li>Brightcove recommends using videos with at least a 2 minute duration to ensure a correct transition between videos and electronic program guide accuracy</li>
      <li>The minimum length for Live events is 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Every Live Event in Cloud Playout shares an 1:1 relation with a Video Cloud remote asset. This remote asset cannot be re-used in other channels. If the live event is removed from the channel, the associated remote asset will be automatically deleted. When a channel is deleted, any associated remote assets will also be deleted automatically.</li>
      <li>When a live event is currently playing, but no active feed is available, the slate content will be played in a loop until the live feed resumes or the event ends. There will be a delay of approximately 30 seconds before the slate MP4 starts playing.</li>
      <!--<li><strong>Input Looper : if the asset URL is duplicated, then input looper rely on order for switching; if the order is changes during the course of the switching , then subsequent N+1 switch it attempt to create would rely on the order. </strong></li>-->
      <li>If the Video Cloud account is configured for geo-restriction, then the channel <strong>Output Region</strong> should be created in a  region compatible with the Video Cloud geo-restriction policy.</li>
      <li>For the best experience, Brightcove recommends using the Google Chrome browser.</li>
