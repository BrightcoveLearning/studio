    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Delivering video to China from outside the country is challenging due to regulations and controls, restricting the free-flow of data across its national borders. Historically, we have provided a solution that allowed Brightcove services to distribute video content through a content delivery network within the country. However, essential communications, including Playback API requests and responses, and Analytics beacons were unreliable, and at times non-functional.</p>

    <p>Brightcove’s China Delivery solution addresses the problems listed above and comprises two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A proxy server hosted within China</li>
      <li>A connected China-specific CDN</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The proxy routes non-video traffic (Playback API requests, Analytics beacons, and the web player itself) to and from viewers in China to Brightcove infrastructure located outside.</p>

    <p>The CDN is connected to the proxy and handles the video and image content.</p>
