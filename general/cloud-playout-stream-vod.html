    <h2 id="publish">Generating the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel</h2>
    <p>To generate the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel, you will use the Live module. For full details on using the Live module, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/live-module/creating-and-managing-live-events-using-live-module.html">Creating and Managing Live Events using the Live Module</a>.</p>
    <p>Two types of embed code are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Standard</strong> - iframe embed code. Recommended for most cases. This type places the player inside an &lt;iframe&gt; tag.</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Advanced</strong> - In-page embed code. Allows the player to exist in the HTML page directly, not in an iframe. This offers developers the benefits of ease of accessing the player and associated properties and events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also have the ability to get the URL to the published player. This is useful for viewing the event in a browser.</p>
    <p>To generate the embed code for a live event, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Open the Live module.</li>
      <li>Locate the live event the channel will be streaming to. Typically, the event will be located in the <strong>Standby</strong> tab and have a name of <strong>Channel</strong> unless you selected a specific event to stream to when the channel was created.</li>
      <li>Click on the event name to open the <strong>Control Room</strong> page.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Publish and Embed &gt; Player Configuration</strong> in the left navigation.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If the channel is configured to enable server-side ads (SSAI),  Brightcove Player version 6.18.3 and above must be used. Only version 6.18.3 and above players will appear in the dropdown list.</aside>
      </li>
      <li class="language-editable">Click the <strong>Player URL</strong> to preview the event in a browser or copy the appropriate embed code to use.

    <h2 id="analytics">Viewing channel output and analytics</h2>
    <p>While the channel is in a <strong>RUNNING</strong> state, it is possible to view channel output and analytics. Click on the channel on the <strong>Channels</strong> page to open the channel details. By default, the channel <strong>Output &amp; Analytics</strong> will be displayed.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>The following assumptions and limitations apply.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Your account must be enabled for Dynamic Delivery</li>
      <li>The Cloud Playout module is not yet integrated with user management. Everyone in the account will have access to the Cloud Playout module.</li>
      <li>The input specification of the Cloud Playout channel is fixed with the following settings: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>CODEC - AVC</li>
        <li>FRAME RATE &lt;= 30fps</li>
        <li> BITRATE &lt;= 20 MBps</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The Cloud Playout channel shall be created only for the account enabled for dynamic packaging and assumes all the assets holds MP4 asset that can be used against the playlist of cloud playout channel.</li>
      <li>When the channel is restarted between the start time and end time,  the program will not be resumed from where it halted in the previous session. Instead, the program will start from the first asset configured in the playlist.</li>
      <li>There will be a delayed transition from invalid asset URL to the other, which means there will be black screen for more time than normal.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to fetch the current EPG for the channel for which scheduled end time is already elapsed and channel is in stopped state, then "EMPTY" EPG will be returned or HTTP Error.</li>
      <li>Current EPG will be generated based on the scheduled start time and end time and its the difference between the end time and start time is greater than 14 days, then it generates only 14 days from the time time requested to end time or 14 days which ever is earlier.</li>
      <li>You can also query EPG based on any start time and end time and it matches with the historic data and consolidates with futuristic EPG based on the playlist to frame it within the scheduled start time or end time &amp; max 14 days.</li>
      <li>Ad insert block will be always enabled for ad avail blanking.</li>
      <li>Ad insert only uses Splice insert mode and not time code based ingest.</li>
      <li>To have more accuracy on historic EPG, you may need to use Asset duration greater than 2 mins.</li>
      <li>Input Looper : if the asset URL is duplicated, then input looper rely on order for switching; if the order is changes during the course of the switching , then subsequent N+1 switch it attempt to create would rely on the order. </li>
      <li>Input Looper : if the current active asset of media live channel is deleted from the playlist, then input looper does not know which one to pick as follow the current asset, hence it considers first asset in the playlist as follow.</li>
      <li>Input Looper : input looper attempts to create schedule action based on various factors every one mins, if the asset duration is less than one min, then there is possibility of delayed switching and causes black screen for more time. ( Still not determined , how frequently the input looper can poll!! , may be 20 sec! considering Ad asset of minimum duration of 30 sec?.)</li>
      <li>The preview image for the CP channel is created on best effort basis.</li>
      <li>in case of backdoor recover process directly onto Medialive may cause discrepancies in configuration/state in cloud playout.</li>
      <li>AD slate provisioned in BC live channel created by CP will be set to default and can be overwritten through API if different ad slate ID to be used during the CP "DRAFT" channel state. </li>
      <li>Below default configuration shall be used while creating the BC live from CP.
        <div>
          <pre>content encryption = none<br>DVR = false<br>Stream to social media = false<br>covert live 2 vod = false<br>Enable stream status notification = false<br>create recurring SEP = true.</pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If the Video Cloud account is configured for geo-restriction, then Cloud Playout channel should be created in the same region where the content can be accessed based upon the Video Cloud geo-restriction policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Electronic Program Guide (EPG) Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The EPG is generated on best effort / with closest to accuracy. </li>
      <li>When EPG is initially constructed from the playlist, there may be a start time error as the CP takes some time to initiate the switching.</li>
      <li>EPG may not be consistent for every retrieval when the below actions are performed as its constructed dynamically based on the current information it holds. (some scenarios are reorder, add/delete of an asset in a playlist, etc.).</li>
      <li>If any malfunction happens in the switching , and switch time is not accurate.</li>
      <li>There could be transit inaccuracy for the future EPG, say some cases like playlist switch, delete current active asset in playlist etc. Consumers should use polling to get the closest , best effort EPG at any time and proactive notification on the changes by the server.</li>
    </ul>
