  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="ads">Enabling Server-Side Ads</h2>
    <p>It is possible to configure a channel so that server-side ads are displayed using Brightcove's Server-Side Ad Insertion technology. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When using ad insertion, the channel can only be output to a Brightcove Live Event.</aside>
    <h3>Configuring Ad tags and fill slates</h3>
    <p>Ensure that you have ad tags and fill slates configured as part of your account administration. For information on configuring ad tags, see <a href="/admin/configuring-server-side-ad-settings.html">Configuring Server-Side Ad Settings</a>. Fill slates are content that can be served when there are gaps in a live stream ad break. For information on creating fill slates, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Managing Live Settings</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Cloud Playout will use the default ad slate configured as part of the <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Live Settings</a>.</aside>
    </p>
    <h3>Creating placeholder ad break videos</h3>
    <p>You need to indicate which video(s) should be used as &quot;placeholder&quot; videos. &quot;Placeholder&quot; videos will be inserted into the program listing to indicate that an ad should be served and the length of the ad. This needs to be done because when using Server-Side Ad Insertion with Brightcove Live, the &quot;placeholder&quot; video will be replaced with ad content. If you do not insert an ad &quot;placeholder&quot; video, parts of the actual video will be replaced with ad content. If the ad duration is shorter than the ad returned, SSAI will show the ad slate. If the ad duration is longer than the ads returned, the ads will be displayed followed by the ad slate. </p>
    <p>You may need to create/upload video source files that have video lengths equal to the ad break durations you want to have (i.e. 2 mins, 4 mins, etc.). The content of these videos doesn't matter as they will not actually be played as part of a program. </p>
    <p>To mark a video as a &quot;placeholder&quot; video, use the Media module to edit the video properties for these videos and tag them with <code translate="No">cp-ad-holder</code>.
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-ad-tag-video.png" /></figure>
    </p>
    <h3>Enabling Server-Side Ads for a channel</h3>
    <p>When creating a channel, set the <strong>Ad Insertion</strong> option to <strong>On</strong>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-ad-insertion-option.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For existing channels, the Ad Insertion setting cannot be changed.</aside>
    <h3>Inserting ad placeholders into a program</h3>
    <p>You need to insert ad placeholders into the program listing where ads should be displayed. Follow these steps to insert ad placeholders.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Click a channel name to edit it.</li>
      <li>In the program listing, click the checkbox next to the video <strong>after</strong> which you want an ad to play.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Insert Ads</strong> and select an <strong>ad duration</strong>. The list of ad durations is generated based upon the lengths of all the ad break &quot;placeholder&quot; videos (tagged <code translate="No">cp-ad-holder</code>).
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-insert-ads-button.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Ok</strong>. The &quot;placeholder&quot; video with the selected length will be inserted into the program after the selected video.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-ad-break-inserted.png" /></figure>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The video that is inserted as a &quot;placeholder&quot; <strong>will not</strong> be played as part of the program. This video is only used to indicate where an ad request will be made and the ad length.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes to the program.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Selecting the ad configuration</h3>
    <p>Once the program begins playing, click <strong>View in Brightcove Live</strong> to view the channel in the Live module. The dropdown below the player can be used to select the ad configuration that will be used.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/general/playout-live-select-ad-config.png" /></figure>

    <h2 id="publish">Generating the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel</h2>
    <p>To generate the embed code for a Cloud Playout channel, you will use the Live module. For full details on using the Live module, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/live-module/creating-and-managing-live-events-using-live-module.html">Creating and Managing Live Events using the Live Module</a>.</p>
    <p>Two types of embed code are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Standard</strong> - iframe embed code. Recommended for most cases. This type places the player inside an &lt;iframe&gt; tag.</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Advanced</strong> - In-page embed code. Allows the player to exist in the HTML page directly, not in an iframe. This offers developers the benefits of ease of accessing the player and associated properties and events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also have the ability to get the URL to the published player. This is useful for viewing the event in a browser.</p>
    <p>To generate the embed code for a live event, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Open the Live module.</li>
      <li>Locate the live event the channel will be streaming to. Typically, the event will be located in the <strong>Standby</strong> tab and have a name of <strong>Channel</strong> unless you selected a specific event to stream to when the channel was created.</li>
      <li>Click on the event name to open the <strong>Control Room</strong> page.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Publish and Embed &gt; Player Configuration</strong> in the left navigation.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If the channel is configured to enable server-side ads (SSAI),  Brightcove Player version 6.18.3 and above must be used. Only version 6.18.3 and above players will appear in the dropdown list.</aside>
      </li>
      <li class="language-editable">Click the <strong>Player URL</strong> to preview the event in a browser or copy the appropriate embed code to use.

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>The following assumptions and limitations apply.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Your videos must be ingested using a Dynamic Delivery profile and  must have an MP4 rendition</li>
      <li>The Cloud Playout module is not yet integrated with user management; everyone in the account will have access to the Cloud Playout module</li>
      <li>Brightcove recommends using videos with at least a 2 minute duration to ensure a correct transition between videos and electronic program guide accuracy</li>
      <!--<li><strong>Input Looper : if the asset URL is duplicated, then input looper rely on order for switching; if the order is changes during the course of the switching , then subsequent N+1 switch it attempt to create would rely on the order. </strong></li>-->
      <li>If the Video Cloud account is configured for geo-restriction, then the channel <strong>Output Region</strong> should be created in a  region compatible with the Video Cloud geo-restriction policy</li>
      <li>For the best experience, Brightcove recommends using the Google Chrome browser</li>
    </ul>
