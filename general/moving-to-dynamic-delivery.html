    <h2 id="dynamic_delivery_overview">Dynamic Delivery Overview</h2>
    <p>Dynamic Delivery is our latest video delivery platform that has many advantages over our previous generation of delivery technology. In particular it allows you to reach a larger set of devices with fewer renditions stored. It also allows you to enable <a href="/general/overview-digital-rights-management-drm-video-cloud.html">DRM</a> and <a href="/media/adding-audio-tracks-videos-using-media-module.html">multiple audio tracks</a> after ingest on a per-video basis.</p>

    <p>While it is unlikely, if you have created custom ingest profiles you may see some changes in the renditions that get generated. We have created the new Dynamic Delivery profiles to optimize playback on a large set of devices, but there may be some minor differences. You can still adjust Dynamic Delivery ingest settings, so take a look at <a href="/admin/creating-ingest-profiles-dynamic-delivery.html">Creating Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>
