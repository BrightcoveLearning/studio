    <p>There are good reasons to migrate to Brightcove's Dynamic Delivery ingest system. Below are some of reasons, information about how to do it, and answers to some frequently asked questions</p>

    <h2 id="dynamic_delivery_overview">Dynamic Delivery Overview</h2>
    <p>Dynamic Delivery is our latest video delivery platform that has many advantages over our previous generation of delivery technology. In particular it allows you to reach a larger set of devices with fewer renditions stored. It also allows you to enable <a href="/general/overview-digital-rights-management-drm-video-cloud.html">DRM</a> and <a href="/media/adding-audio-tracks-videos-using-media-module.html">multiple audio tracks</a> after ingest on a per-video basis.</p>
    <p>For more information on the details and advantages of Dynamic Delivery, see <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/blog/2018/08/why-you-need-just-time-packaging-dynamic-delivery">Why You Need Just-In-Time Packaging with Dynamic Delivery</a> and also our <a href="/general/overview-dynamic-delivery.html">Overview of Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="what_will_change">What Will Change</h2>
    <p>While it is unlikely, if you have created custom ingest profiles you may see some changes in the renditions that get generated. We have created the new Dynamic Delivery profiles to optimize playback on a large set of devices, but there may be some minor differences. You can still adjust Dynamic Delivery ingest settings, so take a look at <a href="/admin/creating-ingest-profiles-dynamic-delivery.html">Creating Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Delivery is already enabled for your account, so you can try it in one of two ways:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use it for all the new videos you upload</dt>
      <dd>You can try Dynamic Delivery for all new videos you add using the Upload Module or the Dynamic Ingest API <a href="/admin/managing-ingest-profiles.html#default">by switching your default ingest profile to one of the Dynamic Delivery profiles</a> defined in your account.</dd>
      <dt>Try Dynamic Delivery for individual video uploads</dt>
      <dd>To try it for individual videos, go to the Upload Module, click on the Ingest Profile selector:
