  <h1>Creating Audio-Only Renditions for Low-Bandwidth Delivery</h1>
  <summary>If you are delivering video to low-bandwidth  devices, such as mobile phones using mobile networks, consider creating a rendition for your videos that has no video track, only an audio track.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p class="language-editable">For example, Apple recommends providing at least one stream at 192 kbps or lower bandwidth for HLS over cellular networks. This low-bandwidth stream could be audio-only or audio with a still image, but you should strive to have video in this stream.</p>

    <p class="language-editable">To create audio-only renditions, add an audio-only ingest profile to your account and then use either the Dynamic Ingest API or the Upload module in Video Cloud Studio. For details, see the <a href="/node/18041">Standard Ingest Profiles</a> developer document.</p>
    <p class="language-editable">Once you have set your audio-only ingest profile, then every time you upload a video, whether you use the Upload module, or the Dynamic Ingest API, the video will include an audio-only rendition along with the other multi-bitrate renditions that are included in your ingest profile.</p>
    <p class="language-editable">Your existing video content will not automatically have an audio-only rendition. To create audio-only renditions for your existing videos, you need to re-encode them. See <a href="/media/retranscoding-videos-using-media-module.html">Retranscoding Videos using the Media Module</a>.</p>

    <p class="language-editable">When an audio-only rendition is&nbsp;played back on&nbsp;an Apple iOS device, the QuickTime player is displayed. In a Flash player, a black video display is shown.</p>
