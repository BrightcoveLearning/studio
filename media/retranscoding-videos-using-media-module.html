    <p>Brightcove reserves the right to update the default ingest profiles associated with Video Cloud accounts. You may also have the need to update your own, custom ingest profiles. When ingest profiles change, you may wish to have existing videos in your account retranscoded so that they have renditions that correspond to the new ingest profile settings.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The ability to retranscode existing videos is available only for Professional and Enterprise accounts. If you are interested in this feature, please contact your Account Manager.</aside>
    <p>Videos can be retranscoded using the Media module or by using the Dynamic Ingest API. Using the Dynamic Ingest API may be a better solution when you have a large number of videos that require retranscoding. To retranscode videos using the Dynamic Ingest API, see the <a href="/node/17948">Dynamic Ingest API Overview</a> developer document.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You cannot retranscode videos that have been shared to your account.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Only videos that were uploaded using the Upload module or using the Dynamic Ingest API, can be retranscoded. If the video can't be retranscoded, the retranscode will fail.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: videos can only be retranscoded if the video master was archived when the video was added to the account. All <a href="/node/18041">Standard Ingest Profiles</a> will archive the master.</aside>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Media module.</li>
      <li>Click on the video you want to retranscode.</li>

        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Videos that were initially transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery or Context Aware ingest profile can only be retranscoded using one of those ingest profile types. Videos transcoded using a Legacy ingest profile can be retranscoded with any type of profile.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Check <strong>Keep existing thumbnail and poster images</strong> to keep the existing images. If you uncheck this box, new images will be generated based upon the image settings in the selected ingest profile.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Retranscode</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While the new renditions are being created, the video will remain playable using the existing renditions.</p>
