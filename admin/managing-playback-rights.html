    <p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in the other Video Cloud accounts. The Media Sharing Settings are used to manage the sharing relationships between accounts.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Media sharing is available only for Video Cloud Enterprise customers. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</aside>
    <p>Media sharing can also be implemented programmatically using the CMS API. For more information, see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/managing-videos/media-sharing-cms-api.html">Media Sharing with the CMS API</a>.</p>
    <p>This topic will use the following terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master</strong> - The account that created the original video. The Master owns the content and is responsible for setting up, managing and providing content to Affiliates.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliate</strong> - The account that is receiving the video. The Affiliate can accept content shared to it from a Master.</li>
    </ul>
