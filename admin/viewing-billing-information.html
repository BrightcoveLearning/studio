    <p>You can use Video Cloud Studio to view the billing information for an account. Note that to access the Billing page, you must be a Video Cloud Studio user with the Administrator role and you must have an annual contract associated with your account. To access the Billing page:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>In the navigation header, click <strong>ADMIN</strong> and then <strong>Billing</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The main Billing page will display.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: If a <strong>Billing Account</strong> dropdown list appears at the top of the page, this indicates you have multiple contracts with Brightcove. Use the dropdown to select a contract to view billing details.</aside>

    <h2 id="metrics">Billing metrics</h2>
    <p>The data displayed on the Billing page will vary based upon the number of accounts you have and your account entitlements. For example, if you do not use DRM, that information will not be displayed.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Billing information for the previous month will not be available until the 7th of the current month.</aside>
    <p>The Contract Overview section may display the following billing metrics.</p>
    <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
    <p>The Bandwidth metric consists of 2 submetrics which are <strong>VOD</strong> Edge bandwith plus <strong>Live</strong> Edge bandwidth. It displays total bandwidth / contracted bandwidth. Total bandwidth includes video and player loads. The name for this metric name will match what you see in your billing invoice to track the bandwidth usage (i.e. it may not display as Bandwidth). If the bandwidth amount is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the bandwidth <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Bandwidth data is delayed by up to 3-5 days, though usually it is available sooner. The data is partly dependent on information from CDNs, so there may be delays on their side that are beyond our control.</aside>
    <h3><strong>Streams</strong></h3>
    <p>The Streams metric displays the total stream starts / contracted stream starts. This should match the number of video views in the Analytics module. If the number of stream starts is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the streams (in thousands) <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The number of stream starts corresponds to the number of video views in the Analytics module.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You may notice discrepancies when comparing billing data to analytics data. This can be due to comparing reconciled billing data to unreconciled analytics data. The reconciliation process requires server logs provided by the CDNs and there may be a delay in getting the server logs and processing the data.</aside>
    <h3><strong>Encryption Licenses</strong></h3>
    <p>The Encryption Licenses metric will display the total DRM licenses / contracted licenses. If the number of licenses used is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the number of licenses used <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that regardless of the Player Preload settings, the encryption is always loaded even before the video is streamed to avoid delay in loading the video. For this reason, you may see more Encryption Licenses than Streams in your billing metrics.</aside>
    <h3><strong>Storage</strong></h3>
    <p>The Storage metric will display the total storage / contracted storage. If the storage used is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the storage used <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Storage is only displayed for Professional and Enterprise accounts.</li>
        <li>Video renditions/assets and digital masters are stored separately, but the Storage metric represents the total combined storage for both renditions/assets and digital masters.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <h3><strong>Transcoding</strong></h3>
    <p>Transcoding refers to the total amount of output GBs processed by Brightcove in connection with the conversion of a video file to additional video formats or bit rates. If the transcoding used is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the transcoding used <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>.</p>
    <h3><strong>Origin Serving Bandwidth</strong></h3>
    <p>Bandwidth usage for bytes delivered only (applies to BYO CDN publishers).</p>
    <h3><strong>Ads Delivered</strong></h3>
    <p>Total number of ads delivered. This also ties to the overall value of the product. This metric also provides data for downstream collateral or information regarding ROI for a publisher using the Live module.</p>
    <h3><strong>Alive Bandwidth</strong></h3>
    <p>Input hours transcoded of your content.</p>
    <h3><strong>Brightcove Live Output Tiers</strong></h3>
    <p>The Brightcove Live Output Tiers metric will display the total live hours/ contracted live hours. If the number of hours is over quota, the graphic will appear in red. The bar chart can be used to view the number of hours used <strong>Contract to Date</strong> or <strong>Month to Date</strong>. When this metric is selected, the output hours for each tier will be displayed above the bar chart.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="select metric" src="/assets/images/admin/node16461-live-output-tiers.png" /></figure>
    <p>It will take 3 days after an event for the Live module hours used and live bandwidth to appear in the Billing UI. Billing by ingestion tier is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tier 1 is charged at 1.0x hours</li>
      <li>Tier 2 is charged at 1.5x hours</li>
      <li>Tier 3 is charged at 2.0x hours</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When using <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/creating-custom-live-ingest-profiles.html">custom Live ingest profiles</a>, the tier will be decided by the total bitrate of the Live profile. Note that with RTMP outputs, billing begins when a job starts to when it ends, including any Reconnect Timeout if an encoder is  shut off.</p>
    <h3><strong>Live Origin</strong></h3>
    <p>Live origin bandwidth is defined as a cache-miss from the CDN and requests that need to be fulfilled by the live origin. It has cost implications on the system when reselling bandwidth and will help assess margins per customer and overall profitability of the platform to drive future pricing discussions.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Live Origin data will not be available in the Billing module.</aside>
    <h3><strong>VOD Origin</strong></h3>
    <p>Live VOD origin bandwidth (BYO CDN).</p>
